# Exercises

# Write a function called times_three_and_plus_five(number) that takes a number, multiplies it by 3, and then adds 5. For example, times_three_and_plus_five(4) should output 17.
# Write a function called even_or_odd(number) that prints "even" if the number is even, and prints "odd" if the number is odd.
# Write a function called division_plus_remainder(big_number, small_number) that finds the number of times small_number completely divides into big_number, and then adds the remainder that's left over. For example, divisor_plus_remainder(7, 2) should equal 4.
# Write a function called is_factor_of(big_number, small_number) that returns true if small_number is a factor of big_number, and false if it is not.
